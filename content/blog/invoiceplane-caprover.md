<a href="https://www.invoiceplane.com" target="_blank">InvoicePlane</a> is a self-hosted open source application for managing your quotes, invoices, clients and payments.

As a fan of <a href="https://caprover.com" target="_blank">Caprover</a>, that I use everyday to manage my web applications, I decided to provide InvoicePlane as a one-click application.

Simply search for the app inside Caprover installation:

Select an app name - can be invoiceplane ðŸ˜€ - and deploy!
