Drilling Computing is a SaaS platform for people in the Oil & Gas field that simplify the task of developing directional plans. 

Python is used for the mathematical computation, as well as for serving the web application using the [Django framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/). 

The platform offers an intelligent algorithm which runs in background and helps the user to develop the best directional plan; background tasks are managed by the [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/) distributed task queue, using [Redis](https://redis.io/) as a broker. 

The user information is stored in [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), a strong and scalable NoSQL database. 

The website uses strong HTTPS encryption by default, with a SSL certificate generated by [Letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), a free and open certificate authority.
