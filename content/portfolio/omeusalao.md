O Meu Salão is a website for hairstyles managers to store information about customers, products, services, sales and to calculate workers commissions. 

It’s a community for the managers being able to promote their activity and capture new clients with offers and vouchers (automatically published on Facebook). 

The application uses a [Percona server for MySQL®](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-server) as a relational database to store the information. 

It integrates online payments with a very known Brazilian gateway called [PagSeguro](https://pagseguro.uol.com.br).
