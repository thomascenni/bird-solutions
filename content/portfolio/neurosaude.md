<a href="https://neurosaude.com" target="_blank">Neurosaude</a> is a personal user blog developed 
with <a href="https://cecil.app" target="_blank">Cecil</a>, a static site generator written in PHP.

Posts data are taken from a <a href="https://getcockpit.com" target="_blank">Cockpit</a> instance 
and converted to Markdown with a simple PHP script. 

This workflow is to avoid the final user, who
is a non-technical person, to learn how to write posts in Markdown, and instead using the Cockpit interface,
with the possibility to define the post title, excerpt, tags, categories and main image.
