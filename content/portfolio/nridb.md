NriDB (Interventional Neuroradiology Database) is a client-server application which allows to manage all the interventions of a Neuroradiology Department. 

It stores information about the patient, the intervention and the material used. 

It generates surgical PDF reports and epidemiological statistics. 

It's completely written in Java, and uses [H2](http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html), a very fast and open source Java SQL database. It incorporates a license manager, allowing to manage trial licences.
